    <p >The first step in designing this web page was to analyze the audience. the audience for this project is young people who are fashion conscious and don't have the time to go to the mall to buy clothes in the stores. Based on the audience, I chose purple and brown colors to make the page look more fashionable. I designed a faster and more efficient buying process to save the user's time. After that, based on the audience's characteristics, I designed a style guide to be used throughout the page, and the content in the style guide can be reused on all pages.
            I then used elements from the style guide to build other pages on the site such as the product list and the shopping cart, both of which use the same elements to maintain a consistent style and make it clear to people that they belong to the same page. On both pages customers can clearly see what the site sells and can visualize the payment process. The website is very efficient for purchasing.

    <p >In this project I used HTML and CSS techniques to develop the website. The focus of this project was on interactivity and usability. I used a lot of interactive effects such as images and links to give the user a sense of interacting with the site. I designed the layout of the website in different resolutions to make the website fit any size screen.</p>
